     The applied Kotlin Gradle is not compatible with the used Gradle version (Gradle 7.5).

     Please update the Gradle version to at least Gradle 7.6.3.

This error occurs because there's a compatibility issue between the Kotlin Gradle plugin and your Gradle version. Let's update the Gradle version to fix this.

First, let's update the Gradle wrapper version:

```properties:android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
// ... existing code ...
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-all.zip
// ... existing code ...
```

Next, let's update the Gradle build configuration:

```groovy:android/build.gradle
// ... existing code ...
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.0'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
// ... existing code ...
```

These changes will:
1. Update the Gradle wrapper to version 7.6.3, which is compatible with the Kotlin Gradle plugin
2. Ensure the build configuration uses compatible versions of the Android Gradle plugin and Kotlin

After making these changes:
1. Run `flutter clean` in your terminal
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Try building your app again

This should resolve the Kotlin Gradle Plugin compatibility issue.

It seems we need to adjust the Kotlin version further to ensure compatibility with all plugins. Let's modify the Kotlin version and Gradle configuration:

```groovy:android/build.gradle
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.6.10'  // Downgrade Kotlin version for better compatibility
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.2.0'  // Downgrade Gradle plugin version
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
// ... existing code ...
```

Now let's also update the app-level build.gradle:

```groovy:android/app/build.gradle
// ... existing code ...
android {
    compileSdkVersion flutter.compileSdkVersion
    ndkVersion flutter.ndkVersion

    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = '1.8'
    }
    // ... existing code ...
}
// ... existing code ...
```

After making these changes:
1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Delete the build folder if it exists
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Try building again with `flutter build apk` or `flutter run`

These changes should provide better compatibility between Kotlin, Gradle, and the Flutter plugins. The downgrade to Kotlin 1.6.10 and Gradle plugin 7.2.0 is often more stable with Flutter's ecosystem and its plugins.

You are applying Flutter's app_plugin_loader Gradle plugin imperatively using the apply script method, which is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Migrate to applying Gradle plugins with the declarative plugins block: https://flutter.dev/to/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply

  Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

  Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (/Users/alejandrorodriguez/Downloads/botbusters_scout_app/android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
  If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (/Users/alejandrorodriguez/Downloads/botbusters_scout_app/android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.

It seems Flutter requires a minimum Kotlin version of 1.7.0. Let's update our configuration to use a compatible version:

```groovy:android/build.gradle
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'  // Update back to 1.7.10 to meet Flutter's minimum requirement
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.2.0'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
// ... existing code ...
```

Also, let's update the Gradle plugin application method in the app-level build.gradle to use the newer plugins block syntax that Flutter recommends:

```groovy:android/app/build.gradle
// Remove these lines
// apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
// apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
// apply from: "$flutterRoot/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/flutter.gradle"

// Add this plugins block at the top of the file
plugins {
    id 'com.android.application'
    id 'kotlin-android'
    id 'dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin'
}

// ... rest of the existing code ...
```

After making these changes:
1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Delete the build folder if it exists
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Try building again with `flutter run`

These changes should:
1. Meet Flutter's minimum Kotlin version requirement
2. Update the plugin application method to the recommended declarative syntax
3. Maintain compatibility with the Gradle version we're using
