_**Assistant**_

This error is coming from your Android Gradle configuration and indicates a version compatibility issue between the Kotlin Gradle plugin and your Gradle version. You'll need to update your Gradle version to at least 7.6.3 to resolve this.

Here's how to fix it. You'll need to modify your `gradle-wrapper.properties` file:

```properties:android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
// ... existing code ...
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.3-all.zip
// ... existing code ...
```

And you might also want to check your project-level `build.gradle` file to ensure you have a compatible Kotlin version:

```groovy:android/build.gradle
// ... existing code ...
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10' // or whatever version you're using
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.0'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
// ... existing code ...
```

After making these changes:
1. Clean your project (`flutter clean`)
2. Delete the build folder if it exists
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Try building again

This should resolve the Kotlin Gradle Plugin compatibility issue.
